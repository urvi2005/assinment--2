    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p>At Local Community News Portal, we take the security of your information very seriously. We use something called encryption to protect your data. This means that when you send us information, like your name and email address, it gets scrambled so that only we can unscramble it and read it.

        We also have something called access controls in place. This means that only certain people on our team can see your information, and they have to use a special password to get to it. We make sure that these passwords are very strong and hard to guess.

Another way we keep your information safe is by doing regular security audits. This is like a check-up for our computer systems to make sure they're working correctly and that there are no weaknesses that someone could exploit.

We also promise to notify you if there's ever a security breach. This means that if someone does manage to get into our system and access your information, we'll let you know right away so you can take steps to protect yourself.

Finally, we want to remind you that you play a big role in keeping your information safe too. Make sure to choose a strong password for your account, and don't share it with anyone. If you have any questions or concerns about security, feel free to contact us.
