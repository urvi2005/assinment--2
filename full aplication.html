<!-- Privacy Page -->
<section id="privacy">
    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>At Local Community News Portal, we care about your privacy. When you use our app, we collect some information about you, like your name, email address, and location. We use this information to give you the best experience possible, like showing you news and events that are happening right in your neighborhood.

        We also use information to improve our app and make it more useful for you. Sometimes, we might share your information with partners who help us make the app work better. We promise to only share your information with people who will protect it just like we do.
        
        You have the right to control your own information. You can update your info or delete your account whenever you want. We also give you the option to opt-out of emails and notifications if you don't want to receive them anymore.
        
        We take security very seriously. We use special tools to protect your information and keep it safe. We also do regular checks to make sure everything is working correctly..</p>
</section>
<!-- Terms Page -->
<section id="terms">
    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p>At Local Community News Portal, we take the security of your information very seriously. We use something called encryption to protect your data. This means that when you send us information, like your name and email address, it gets scrambled so that only we can unscramble it and read it.

        We also have something called access controls in place. This means that only certain people on our team can see your information, and they have to use a special password to get to it. We make sure that these passwords are very strong and hard to guess.

Another way we keep your information safe is by doing regular security audits. This is like a check-up for our computer systems to make sure they're working correctly and that there are no weaknesses that someone could exploit.

We also promise to notify you if there's ever a security breach. This means that if someone does manage to get into our system and access your information, we'll let you know right away so you can take steps to protect yourself.

Finally, we want to remind you that you play a big role in keeping your information safe too. Make sure to choose a strong password for your account, and don't share it with anyone. If you have any questions or concerns about security, feel free to contact us.
